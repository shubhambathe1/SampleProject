If you do not have the currency of the country you are visiting on your Card at all (or not enough to cover the cost of a purchase), you can still use it to make a payment. The Currency (-ies) of the Card will automatically be converted into Local Currency, in the order described above. It is possible for a transaction to be funded from multiple Currencies (this process will occur automatically by drawing funds from the Currencies loaded on your Card in the above default order, until the total amount of the transaction is satisfied). For example, if you have the following Currencies and amounts loaded onto your Card; GBÂ£250, EUâ‚¬10, and AU$100, you are in France and want to make a purchase for EUâ‚¬20, the Card will automatically check the Currencies on the Card, starting at EUâ‚¬ (being the relevant Local Currency) and then GBÂ£, from which to fulfill the remaining EUâ‚¬10, in order to authorize the transaction. If EUâ‚¬ arenâ€™t available, the Card will move along the list until it finds an available Currency from which to deduct payment. You do not need to have the total amount required for the transaction in a single Currency, as long as the total amount of all your converted Currency balances is greater than the relevant transaction amount. Please note that any transactions in a currency other than a Currency loaded on the Card will be exchanged to the relevant Currency/ies on the Card at an exchange rate determined by MasterCard on the day the transaction is processed plus a Currency Conversion Fee as set out in the Table of Fees and Limits.'
